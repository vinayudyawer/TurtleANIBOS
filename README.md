# Tiwi Island Olive Ridley Turtle Tracks
Repository to display Olive Ridley Turtle satellite tracks deployed in collaboration with the Tiwi Island Marine Rangers in 2022.

This repository is not a live feed of the turtle tracks, but is updated once every week to allow the Tiwi Island Rangers and local stakeholders to keep updated on the movements of the Olive Ridley Turtles they assisted in tracking
